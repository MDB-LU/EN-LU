	<h2>Exercise 2</h2>
<p>Here is a conversation between Aunt Polly and Tom. Complete Aunt Polly's questions.</p>
<br>
<p>AUNT POLLY: Oh, Tom. You bad boy. I thought that you were dead. Where <input type="text" id="10" name="10">?</p>
<p>TOM: On Jackson's Island.</p>
<p>AUNT POLLY: Jackson's Island? Why <input type="text" id="11" name="11">?</p>
<p>TOM: Because we wanted to do something exciting.</p>
<p>AUNT POLLY: What's so exciting about Jackson's Island? There's nothing there. Where <input type="text" id="12" name="12">?</p>
<p>TOM: Under the trees. It was wonderful.</p>
<p>AUNT POLLY: Well, I don't know! What <input type="text" id="13" name="13">?</p>
<p>TOM: We took some bread and meat with us. Then, in the morning, we went fishing and got fish for our breakfast.</p>

	<h2>Exercise 3</h2>
<p>Here is a newspaper report about the treasure. There are ten mistakes in the report. Can you find all of them?</p>
<br>
<p>Two children, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, found twelve hundred dollars in a bag in McDougal's Cave. Muff Potter found the money under a tree and put it in a big room at the end of a tunnel. He marked the floor of the tunnel with a cross. But then he couldn't get out of the cave because of the ghosts at the mouth of the cave. When the men found him, he was alive, so there is going to be a trial.</p>
