    <p><h1>5 days to become a better speaker</h1></p>
	<p>On this page you can improve your speaking skills. Download the following worksheet, which you will need for every task of the course:</p>
	<p><a href="5 Days Speaking - Worksheet.docx" target="_blank">Worksheet</a></p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Day 1</h2></p>
	<p>50 percent of a conversation is about understanding the other person. So listening is an important part of speaking. And this is exactly where we will start.</p>
	<p>Listen to at least one of the recordings and write down five words you didn't understand in your worksheet.</p>
	
	<p><h3>Audio 1 - Try something new for 30 days</h3></p>
	<span lang="de">
	<audio controls>
        <source src="Speaking Audio 1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    	</audio>
	</span>

	<p><h3>Audio 2 - The danger of silence</h3></p>
	<span lang="de">
	<audio controls>
        <source src="Speaking Audio 2.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    	</audio>
	</span>

	<p><h3>Audio 3 - Got a meeting? Take a walk!</h3></p>
	<span lang="de">
	<audio controls>
        <source src="Speaking Audio 3.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    	</audio>
	</span>
<br>
	<p><h2>Day 2</h2></p>
	<p>Have you written down five words in Task 1? Great! But now let's find out what they mean.</p>

<br>
	<p><h2>Day 3</h2></p>
	<p>Reading aloud is a great way to improve fluency and pronunciation.</p>
	<p>In your worksheet, you will find a text about the author Ray Bradbury. Read this text aloud.</p>
	<p>Repeat this a couple of times and you will soon realize your improvement.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Day 4</h2></p>
	<p>The text about Ray Bradbury is not the easiest one. I'm sure that there are a couple of words you did not understand. So that is a great excuse to repeat the tips from day 1 and 2.</p>
	<p>Write down 5 unknown words from the text in your worksheet. Find their translation with an online dictionary and write them down as well.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Task 5</h3></p>
	<p>Click the following link and you will be directed to a page where you can record yourself reading aloud the text about Ray Bradbury.</p>
	<p><a href="5 Days Speaking - Recording.html" target="_blank">Recording</a></p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Day 5</h2></p>
	<p>This is already the last day of your five-day plan to become a better English speaker. Head over to the worksheet and follow the instructions in <strong>Task 6</strong> to finish the course.</p>
