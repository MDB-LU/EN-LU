	<p><h1>Who wants to be a millionaire?</h1></p>
	<p>On this page you have the chance to play the game <strong>Who wants to be a millionaire?</strong> The questions are all about English grammar. Will you be able to go all the way through to the million dollar question?</p>
	<p>Before you test your knowledge, here are some instructions of how to play the game:</p>
	<p>To navigate the questions and answers, you just have to use <strong>arrow up and arrow down</strong>. For every question, you have four options. Select the answer with <strong>the space bar <span lang="de">(Leertaste)</span></strong>. If you want to change your answer, just move up and down to your desired answer and press the space bar again. To go to the next question, move down to the end of the page where you will find the <strong><span lang="de">"Antwort pr√ºfen" - Schalter</span></strong>. Activate this button with <strong>Enter</strong> and you will get feedback if your answer is correct or not. If your answer is correct, you will move on to the next question. If you get a question wrong, you have to start again with the first question.</p>
	<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>
	<p>If you move on to the next question, your cursor might not be at the beginning of the page. Press <strong>Control + Home</strong> to get to the beginning of the page to listen to the question. Also, when you listen to the options, you will hear the following sentence after each option: <strong>Auswahlschalter nicht aktiviert</strong>. This sentence is in German, but Fusion thinks it is English, which is why it will sound weird. You will get used to it, after a couple of questions.</p>
