	<p><h1>Past Continuous</span></h1></p>
	<p>We use the Past Continuous to show a continuous action that began in the past. It is the past tense version of the present continuous, which also describes ongoing actions.</p>
	<p>In order to form the Past Continuous, we need the auxiliary verbs <strong>was</strong> or <strong>were</strong> and the <strong>ing form</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He was going to the supermarket.</p>
	<p>You were wearing a white shirt.</p>
	<p>I was working in my garden.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past Continuous - Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentences in the Past Continuous, we need to add the word <strong>not</strong>. This word comes between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I was not watching television.</p>
	<p>You were not listening.</p>
	<p>He wasn't cooking.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past Continuous - Questions</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to ask a question in the Past Continuous, we have to put the auxiliary verb <strong>was</strong> or <strong>were</strong> in front of the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Were you working in your garden?</p>
	<p>Was he eating his food?</p>
	<p>What was I drinking?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past Continuous - Uses</h2></p>
	<p>You now know how we make the Past Contiuous in positive and negative questions, as well as in questions. But when do we use this tense?</p>

	<p><strong>Example</strong>: Martha <strong>was leaving</strong> the apartment when she saw Jim.</p>
	<p>2. Ongoing actions at a specified time in the past:</p>
	<p><strong>Example</strong>: At midnight, everybody <strong>was having</strong> fun.</p>
