	<p><h3>Tom Cruise</h3></p>
	<p>Tom Cruise, born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, is one of the most successful and recognizable actors in the world. With a career spanning over four decades, Cruise has captivated audiences with his versatile performances, charismatic screen presence, and commitment to his craft. His journey from a challenging childhood to becoming a Hollywood superstar is a testament to his talent, dedication, and enduring appeal. Tom Cruise was born into a turbulent family environment. His father, Thomas Cruise Mapother III, was an electrical engineer, and his mother, Mary Lee, was a special education teacher. Cruise's family moved frequently due to his father's job, which led to a nomadic childhood. This instability, coupled with his father's abusive behavior, created a challenging upbringing for Cruise and his three sisters. Cruise's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother took the children to Louisville, Kentucky. There, Cruise attended a Franciscan seminary and considered becoming a priest. However, his passion for acting soon took precedence. Cruise struggled with dyslexia, which made academics difficult, but he found solace and confidence in school plays and drama classes.</p>
	<p>Cruise's acting career began in the early 1980s with small roles in films like "Endless Love" (1981) and "Taps" (1981). His breakthrough came with the 1983 film "Risky Business," where his portrayal of a high school student who turns his parents' home into a brothel made him a household name. The iconic scene of Cruise dancing in his underwear to Bob Seger's "Old Time Rock and Roll" became a cultural touchstone. Following "Risky Business," Cruise solidified his status as a leading man with a series of successful films. In 1986, he starred in "Top Gun," a high-octane action film about Navy fighter pilots. The film was a massive box office hit and turned Cruise into a global superstar. His role as the cocky but talented pilot, Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, became one of the most iconic characters in cinema history.</p>
	<p>Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Cruise showcased his versatility by taking on a variety of roles in different genres. He starred in "The Color of Money" (1986) alongside Paul Newman, earning critical acclaim for his performance. In 1988, he played a bartender in "Cocktail," and in 1989, he starred in "Rain Man" with Dustin Hoffman, a film that won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Cruise's portrayal of Ron Kovic, a paralyzed Vietnam War veteran, in "Born on the Fourth of July" (1989) earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His commitment to the role, including his immersion into Kovic's life and experiences, demonstrated his dedication to his craft. In the 1990s, Cruise continued to deliver memorable performances. He starred in "A Few Good Men" (1992), where his courtroom showdown with Jack Nicholson became legendary. His role in "The Firm" (1993) and his collaboration with director Martin Scorsese in "The Color of Money" further cemented his reputation as a talented and bankable star.</p>
	<p>In 1996, Cruise took on the role of Ethan Hunt in "Mission: Impossible," a film adaptation of the popular television series. As both the star and producer, Cruise played a crucial role in shaping the franchise. The film's success led to multiple sequels, with Cruise performing many of his own stunts, which became a hallmark of the series. His dedication to authenticity and action-packed sequences has been a significant factor in the franchise's enduring popularity.</p>
	<p>Cruise's personal life has often been in the spotlight. He married actress Mimi Rogers in 1987, but the marriage ended in divorce in 1990. Shortly after, he married actress Nicole Kidman, with whom he adopted two children. Their high-profile marriage lasted until 2001. In 2006, Cruise married actress Katie Holmes, and the couple had a daughter, Suri. However, their marriage ended in divorce in 2012. Cruise's association with the Church of Scientology has also been a subject of public interest and controversy. A devoted Scientologist, Cruise has often defended the church and credited it with helping him overcome his dyslexia. His advocacy for Scientology, along with his sometimes controversial statements, has occasionally affected his public image. Despite the ups and downs of his personal life, Cruise's professional career has remained remarkably resilient. He continued to deliver box office hits throughout the 2000s and 2010s, with notable films such as "Minority Report" (2002), "The Last Samurai" (2003), "Collateral" (2004), and "War of the Worlds" (2005). His role in "Jerry Maguire" (1996) earned him a second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, and his performance in "Magnolia" (1999) garnered a nomination for Best Supporting Actor.</p>
	<p>Cruise's commitment to his craft is evident in his willingness to take on physically demanding roles. In the "Mission: Impossible" series, he performed increasingly dangerous stunts, including hanging from the side of an airplane in "Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation" (2015) and performing a HALO jump in "Mission: Impossible – Fallout" (2018). These stunts not only thrilled audiences but also demonstrated Cruise's dedication to delivering authentic and exhilarating cinematic experiences. Beyond his film career, Cruise has been involved in various philanthropic efforts. He has supported numerous charities and causes, including the Church of Scientology's humanitarian initiatives, as well as organizations focused on health, education, and disaster relief. His contributions to the entertainment industry have been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including the American Cinematheque Award and the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film.</p>
