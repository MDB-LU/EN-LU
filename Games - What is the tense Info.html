	<p><h1>What's the tense?</h1></p>
	<p>On this page, you can play a game called <strong>What's the tense?</strong></p>
	<p>This game is all about the different tenses in English, so make sure to have a look at those on the <span lang="de">Lernumgebung</span>.</p>
	<p>The passive form of the different tenses will be tested as well. If you want to know how we make the passive, then click the following link:</p>
	<p><a href="The Passive.html" target="_blank">Passives</a></p>
<br>
	<p>As soon as you click on the link below, a timer will start. There are <strong>three minutes</strong> on the clock.</p>
	<p>At the top of the page, you always have a sentence with one verb form. Your task is to decide which <strong>tense</strong> this verb form is in.</p>
	<p>For every question, you have four options. Choose the correct option.</p>
	<p>You will find out if your answer was wrong or right and then the next question appears.</p>
	<p>You will be informed once the time is up. After that, you can see how many questions you answered correctly.</p>
