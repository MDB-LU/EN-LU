	<p><h1>Past Simple - Negatives</h1></p>
	<p>If we want to use the negative in the Past Simple, we have to use an auxiliary verb. Most of the time this auxiliary verb is <strong>didn't</strong>. <strong>Didn't</strong> stands for <strong>did not</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I didn't work in a bank.</p>
	<p>We didn't play football.</p>
	<p>They didn't buy a house.</p>
<br>
	<p>We use the auxiliary verb <strong>didn't</strong> in every person.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I didn't work</p>
	<p>You didn't work</p>
	<p>He didn't work / She didn't work / It didn't work</p>
	<p>We didn't work</p>
	<p>You didn't work</p>
	<p>They didn't work</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>When we use the auxiliary verb <strong>didn't</strong>, we have to use the base form (infinitive) of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I didn't work in a bank. <strong>NOT:</strong> I didn't worked in a bank.</p>
	<p>She didn't catch the ball. <strong>NOT:</strong> She didn't caught the ball.</p>
