	<p><h1>Mount Cook</h1></p>
	<p>Mount Cook or Aoraki is the highest mountain in New Zealand.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Location</h2></p>
	<p>The mountain is in the Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park, in the Canterbury Region. The park was established in 1953 and along with Westland National Park, Mount Aspiring National Park and Fiordland National Park forms one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The park contains more than 140 peaks standing over 2,000 metres and 72 named glaciers, which cover 40 percent of its 700 square kilometres.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Local Climate</h2></p>
	<p>Temperatures at the mountain's base in the Hooker Valley around 800 metres range from −13 °C to 32 °C and generally fall just over 1 °C for every 200 metres of altitude. From about 1,000 m and higher, semi-permanent snow and ice fields exist during winter. Winter and spring are usually less settled than summer and autumn. Anticyclones often bring days of settled weather in summer, or clear cold conditions in winter with severe frost.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>European Discovery</h2></p>
	<p>The first Europeans who may have seen Mount Cook were members of Abel Tasman's crew, who saw a large land uplifted high (probably some part of the Southern Alps) while off the west coast of the South Island on 13 December 1642 during Tasman's first Pacific voyage. The English name of Mount Cook was given to the mountain in 1851 by Captain John Lort Stokes to honour Captain James Cook who surveyed and circumnavigated the islands of New Zealand in 1770. Captain Cook did not sight the mountain during his exploration.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Height</h2></p>
	<p>Aoraki / Mount Cook is the highest mountain in New Zealand. Its height, as of 2014, is listed as 3724 metres.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Maori history, legends and traditions</h2></p>
	<p>According to Maori legend, Aoraki was a young boy who, along with his three brothers, were the sons of Rakinui, the Sky Father. On their voyage around the Papatuanuku, the Earth Mother, their canoe became stranded on a reef and tilted. Aoraki and his brothers climbed onto the top side of their canoe. However, the south wind froze them and turned them to stone. Their canoe became the Te Waka o Aoraki, the South Island. Aoraki, the tallest, became the highest peak.</p>
