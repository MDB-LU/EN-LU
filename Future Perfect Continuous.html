	<p><h1>Future Perfect Continuous</h1></p>
	<p>We use the <strong>Future Perfect Continuous</strong> when we are looking back to the past from a point in the future and we want to emphasise the length or duration of an activity or event.</p>
	<p>To make the future perfect continuous, we have to use the word <strong>will</strong>, the auxiliary verb <strong>have been</strong> and the <strong>-ing form</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Next August, the teacher will have been working at the school for 30 years.</p>
	<p>In September, she will have been living in Australia for a year.</p>
	<p>I will have been studying Spanish for three years by the end of this course.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentence in the future perfect continuous, we have to add the word <strong>not</strong> after <strong>will</strong> and before <strong>have been</strong>.</p>
	<p>We can also use the abbreviation <strong>won't</strong> which stands for <strong>will not</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Next August, the teacher will not have been working at the same school for 30 years.</p>
	<p>In September, she won't have been living in Australia for a year.</p>
	<p>I will not have been studying Spanish for three years by the end of this course.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Questions</h2></p>
	<p>We can also make questions in the future perfect continuous. We just have to put <strong>will</strong> before the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Will she have been working here for three years next Monday?</p> 
	<p>Will they have been living together for a year tomorrow?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2><p>
	<p>We can use the word <strong>shall</strong> instead of <strong>will</strong> for the person <strong>I</strong> and <strong>we</strong>.</p>
	<p>Shall is more formal and less common than will.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>Next week, I shall have been working here for ten years.</p>
