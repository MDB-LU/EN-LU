	<p>On this page you can learn some jokes that you can record to practice your speaking.</p>

	<p><h2>Task</h2></p>
	<p>You will be able to download a document in which you will find a couple of jokes. Read through the jokes and choose three of them.</p>
	<p>If you have chosen three jokes, start learning them by heart. Don't just read or listen to the jokes, say them aloud as well.</p>
	<p>Once you feel ready to present your jokes, record them by following the link at the end of the page. There, you can listen to your jokes and check, if you want to practice more, or if everything's perfect already.</p>
