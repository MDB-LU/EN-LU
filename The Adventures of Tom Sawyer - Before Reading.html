	<p><h1>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer - Before Reading</h1></p>
	<p>On this page, you will find a couple of tasks that you should do before you start reading the book.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Exercise 1</h2></p>
	<p>Read the following two texts about the book and choose the correct options for the questions below.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Story Introduction</h3></p>
	<p>Tom Sawyer likes adventures. When other people are sleeping in their beds, Tom Sawyer is climbing out of his bedroom window to meet his friends. He and Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn have an exciting life. They look for ghosts, they dig for treasure, and they take a boat down the Mississippi to Jackson's Island - to swim, and fish, and sleep under the stars.</p>
<p>But Tom's adventures can be dangerous, too. One night in the graveyard he and Huck Finn see three men. Who are they? And what are they doing in the graveyard, in the middle of the night? Then the boys see that one of the men is Injun Joe.</p>
<p>Tom and Huck never forget that night. They are afraid of Injun Joe - and they are right to be afraid. Because Injun Joe is very quick with a knife.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Back Cover</h3></p>
	<p>Tom Sawyer does not like school. He does not like work, and he never wants to get out of bed in the morning. But he likes swimming and fishing, and having adventures with his friends. And he has a lot of adventures. One night, he and his friend Huck Finn go to the graveyard to look for ghosts.</p>
	<p>They don't see any ghosts that night. They see something worse than a ghost - much, much worse.</p>
<br>
