	<p><h3>Robin Williams</h3></p>
	<p>Robin Williams, a beloved actor and comedian, touched the hearts of millions with his extraordinary talent, infectious energy, and compassionate spirit. Born on July 21, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois, Robin McLaurin Williams' journey from a shy, introspective child to one of the most celebrated performers of his generation is a story of remarkable creativity, resilience, and enduring impact. Robin Williams was born to Laurie McLaurin, a former model, and Robert Fitzgerald Williams, a senior executive at Ford Motor Company. Raised in a well-to-do family, Williams had a comfortable childhood, though he often felt lonely as an only child. He developed a keen sense of humor early on, using it as a way to make friends and gain attention. Williams attended Detroit Country Day School and later Redwood High School in California, where his penchant for comedy began to flourish. After high school, he studied political science at Claremont McKenna College but soon realized his true passion lay in performance. He transferred to the College of Marin to study theater, eventually earning a scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School in New York City. At Juilliard, Williams honed his craft under the tutelage of John Houseman and alongside future stars such as Christopher Reeve. Houseman recognized Williams' unique comedic talent and encouraged him to pursue a career in comedy. Williams left Juilliard in 1976, ready to embark on his professional journey.</p>
	<p>Robin Williams began his career as a stand-up comedian in San Francisco and Los Angeles, where his frenetic energy, quick wit, and improvisational skills quickly set him apart. His performances were a whirlwind of characters, voices, and off-the-cuff humor, captivating audiences and earning him a devoted following. In 1978, Williams' big break came when he was cast as the alien Mork in the TV show "Happy Days." His guest appearance was so popular that it led to the spin-off series "Mork & Mindy," which ran from 1978 to 1982. The role showcased Williams' comedic genius and catapulted him to national fame. As Mork, Williams brought his unique brand of humor to mainstream television, endearing himself to millions of viewers with his zany antics and heartfelt moments.</p>
	<p>Williams' transition to film was seamless, with his versatility allowing him to excel in both comedic and dramatic roles. His first major film role was in "Popeye" (1980), but it was his performance in "Good Morning, Vietnam" (1987) that established him as a leading actor. Playing the irreverent radio DJ Adrian Cronauer, Williams earned his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor, showcasing his ability to blend comedy with poignant drama. Throughout the 1990s, Williams delivered a string of iconic performances. In "Dead Poets Society" (1989), he portrayed the inspiring English teacher John Keating, whose mantra "carpe diem" resonated with audiences and earned him another Academy Award nomination. His role as the Genie in Disney's "Aladdin" (1992) was a tour de force of voice acting, bringing boundless energy and humor to the animated film. Williams continued to demonstrate his range with films like "Mrs. Doubtfire" (1993), where he played a loving father disguised as a Scottish nanny, and "The Birdcage" (1996), where he brought depth and warmth to his role as a gay nightclub owner. His performance in "Good Will Hunting" (1997) as the compassionate therapist Sean Maguire won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, solidifying his reputation as a gifted dramatic actor.</p>
