<body>
	<p><h1>Relative Clauses</h1></p>
	<p>Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something. We can use relative clauses to combine clauses without repeating information.</p>
	<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
	<p><strong>Original:</strong> The couple sent a Christmas present to their daughter. Their daughter lives in America.</p>
	<p><strong>Relative Clause:</strong> The couple sent a Christmas present to their daughter, who lives in America.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Defining Relative Clauses</h2></p>
	<p>We use <strong>defining relative clauses</strong> to give essential information about someone or something. This is information that we need in order to understand what or who is being referred to. A defining relative clause usually comes immediately after the noun it describes.</p>
	<p>We usually use a <strong>relative pronoun (who, that, which, whose and whom)</strong> to introduce a defining relative clause.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>They are the people who want to buy our house. (In this sentences the defining relative clause is: <strong>who want to buy our house</strong>. It refers to <strong>the people</strong>).</p>
	<p>Here are some cells which have not been affected. (In this sentences the defining relative clause is: <strong>which have not been affected</strong>. It refers to <strong>some cells</strong>).</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>IMPORTANT</h3><p>
	<p>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> use commas in defining relative clauses.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Non-Defining Relative Clauses</h2></p>
	<p>We use <strong>non-defining relative clauses</strong> to give extra information about the person or thing. It is not necessary information. We don’t need it to understand who or what is being referred to.</p>
	<p>We always use a <strong>relative pronoun (who, which, whose or whom)</strong> to introduce a non-defining relative clause.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Jimmy, who I work with, is doing the London Marathon this year. (In this sentences the non-defining relative clause is: <strong>who I work with</strong>. It refers to <strong>Jimmy</strong>).</p>
	<p>Roger Federer, who has won 20 Grand Slam titles, does not play tennis anymore. (In this sentences the non-defining relative clause is: <strong>who has won 20 Grand Slam titles</strong>. It refers to <strong>Roger Federer</strong>).</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>IMPORTANT</h3></p>
	<p>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the relative pronoun <strong>THAT</strong> to introduce a non-defining relative clause.</p>
	<p>We <strong>NEED</strong> commas around the non-defining relative clause.<p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Defining vs. Non-Defining Relative Clauses</h2></p>
	<p>Sometimes defining and non-defining relative clauses can look very similar but have different meanings.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Defining:</strong> His brother who works at the supermarket is a friend of mine. (In this sentence, the person has more than one brother. The one I’m talking about works at the supermarket.)</p>
	<p><strong>Non-Defining:</strong> His brother, who works at the supermarket, is a friend of mine. (In this sentence, the person only has one brother, and that brother works at the supermarket.)</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>IMPORTANT</h3></p>
	<p>The information in a <strong>defining relative clause</strong> is essential, so we can’t leave out the relative clause.</p>
	<p>The information in a <strong>non-defining relative clause</strong> is extra information which isn’t essential, so we can leave out the relative clause.</p>
