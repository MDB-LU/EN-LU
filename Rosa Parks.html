	<p><h3>Rosa Parks</h3></p>
	<p>Rosa Parks, often referred to as "the mother of the civil rights movement," holds a seminal place in American history. Born on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama, Rosa Louise McCauley's act of defiance on a Montgomery bus ignited a nationwide effort to end racial segregation and discrimination. Her story is one of quiet strength, unwavering resolve, and profound impact. Rosa Parks was born to James McCauley, a carpenter, and Leona Edwards McCauley, a teacher. After her parents separated, Rosa moved with her mother and younger brother, Sylvester, to Pine Level, Alabama, where they lived on a farm with her maternal grandparents. It was here, in the deeply segregated South, that Rosa first encountered the harsh realities of racial discrimination. Despite these challenges, Rosa's family emphasized the importance of education. She attended the Industrial School for Girls in Montgomery and later enrolled at the Alabama State Teachers College for Negroes (now Alabama State University). However, she was forced to leave before graduating to care for her ill grandmother and mother.</p>
	<p>In 1932, Rosa married Raymond Parks, a barber and active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Raymond's involvement in civil rights greatly influenced Rosa, and together they became key figures in the Montgomery NAACP chapter. Rosa served as the chapter's secretary and worked alongside civil rights leaders, including E.D. Nixon and Martin Luther King Jr. During this time, Rosa Parks became increasingly involved in efforts to combat racial injustice. She investigated cases of racial violence, advocated for voting rights, and attended civil rights training sessions. Her dedication to the cause was unwavering, but it was her act of defiance on December 1, 1955, that would propel her into the national spotlight.</p>
	<p>On that fateful day in 1955, Rosa Parks boarded a Montgomery city bus after a long day of work as a seamstress. When the bus became crowded, the driver ordered Parks and three other black passengers to give up their seats for white passengers. While the others complied, Parks refused, quietly stating, "I don't think I should have to stand up." Her refusal was not born out of physical fatigue but rather a deep-seated exhaustion from the constant humiliation and oppression of segregation. Rosa Parks was arrested and fined for violating segregation laws. Her arrest sparked outrage within the African American community, leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Organized by the Montgomery Improvement Association and led by a then-unknown pastor named Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted for 381 days. African Americans in Montgomery refused to use the city buses, opting instead to walk, carpool, or use alternative means of transportation. The boycott had a significant financial impact on the bus system and brought national attention to the civil rights movement. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional, marking a major victory for civil rights activists and setting the stage for further desegregation efforts across the country.</p>
	<p>Despite her pivotal role in the boycott, Rosa Parks faced severe repercussions. She lost her job as a seamstress and received numerous threats. In 1957, she and her husband moved to Detroit, Michigan, seeking better opportunities and less hostility. In Detroit, Parks continued her work as a civil rights advocate, collaborating with leaders like Congressman John Conyers, for whom she worked as an administrative assistant from 1965 until her retirement in 1988. Throughout her life, Parks remained active in the fight for racial equality. She co-founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development, which focused on youth education and empowerment. Parks also wrote several books, including her autobiography, "Rosa Parks: My Story," and "Quiet Strength," in which she reflected on her life and the principles that guided her.</p>
	<p>Rosa Parks' courage and determination left an indelible mark on American society. Her actions on that Montgomery bus catalyzed the civil rights movement and inspired countless individuals to join the fight against racial injustice. Parks received numerous accolades for her contributions, including the NAACP's Spingarn Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional Gold Medal. In 1999, Time magazine named her one of the 20 most influential people of the 20th century. Her legacy is also honored through various landmarks and institutions, such as the Rosa Parks Library and Museum in Montgomery and the Rosa Parks Transit Center in Detroit. Rosa Parks passed away on October 24, 2005, at the age of 92. Her death was a significant moment in American history, and she was honored by lying in state at the U.S. Capitol, a rare tribute for a private citizen.</p>
	<p>Rosa Parks' life is a powerful testament to the impact of individual action in the pursuit of justice and equality. Her refusal to give up her seat on that Montgomery bus was a simple yet profound act of defiance that sparked a movement and changed the course of American history. Parks' legacy serves as a reminder that the fight for civil rights is ongoing and that courage and conviction can make a lasting difference. Her story continues to inspire generations to stand up against injustice and to believe in the possibility of a more equitable and just world. Rosa Parks' legacy is not just a historical footnote but a beacon of hope and resilience, demonstrating that one person's actions can indeed spark monumental change.</p>
