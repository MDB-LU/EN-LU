<body>
	<p><h1>Present Simple - Third Person -S</h1></p>
	<p>The form of the verb in positive sentences and the auxiliary verb in negative sentences and questions in the Present Simple is the same in every person <strong>except</strong> for the third person singular. In the third person singular, we have to add the letter <strong>s</strong> to the end of the verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>First person singular: I like chocolate.</p>
	<p>Second person singular: You like chocolate.</p>
	<p>Third person singular: He likes chocolate. / She likes chocolate. / It likes chocolate.</p>
	<p>First person plural: We like chocolate.</p>
	<p>Second person plural: You like chocolate.</p>
	<p>Third person plural: They like chocolate.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Simple - Negative sentences in the third person singular</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentence in the Present Simple which is in the third person singular, we have to use an auxiliary verb. Most of the time, this auxiliary verb is <strong>doesn't</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Doesn't</strong> stands for <strong>does not</strong>.
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He doesn't work in a bank.</p>
	<p>She doesn't play football.</p>
	<p>It doesn't work.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Simple - Questions in the third person singular</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to ask a question in the Present Simple which is in the third person, we have to use an auxiliary verb. Most of the time, this auxiliary verb is <strong>does</strong>.
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Does he work in a bank?</p>
	<p>Does she play football?</p>
	<p>Does it work?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>When we use the auxiliary verb <strong>doesn't</strong> in negative sentences or <strong>does</strong> in questions, we have to use the base form of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He doesn't work in a bank. <strong>NOT:</strong> He doesn't works in a bank.</p>
	<p>Does he work in a bank? <strong>NOT:</strong> Does he works in a bank?</p>
