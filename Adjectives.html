<body>
	<p><h1>Adjectives</h1></p>
	<p>Adjectives are words that describe a noun or a pronoun.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>My sister is happy. (The adjective <strong>happy</strong> describes the noun <strong>sister</strong>.)</p>
	<p>He looks tired. (The adjective <strong>tired</strong> describes the pronoun <strong>he</strong>.)</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Comparative</h2></p>
	<p>If we compare two things, we have to use the comparative form of the adjective.</p>
<br>	
	<p>If the adjective only has one syllable, we can add the ending <strong>er</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>My brother is <strong>stronger</strong> than you.</p>
<br>
	<p>If the adjective has two syllables but ends with the letter <strong>y</strong>, we have to change the <strong>y</strong> into an <strong>i</strong> before adding the ending <strong>er</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>My sister is <strong>funnier</strong> than your brother.</p>
	<p>My room is <strong>dirtier</strong> than yours.</p>
<br>
	<p>If the adjective has two or more syllables, the adjective stays the same, but we have to add the word <strong>more</strong> before the adjective.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>My shirt was <strong>more expensive</strong> than yours.</p>
	<p>New York is <strong>more dangerous</strong> than Berlin.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>When we compare two things with each other, we have to use the comparative and the word <strong>than</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>His friend is taller <strong>than</strong> you.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Superlative</h2></p>
	<p>We use the superlative form of the adjective to describe something as being of the highest degree.</p>
<br>	
	<p>If the adjective only has one syllable, we can add the ending <strong>est</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>My brother is the <strong>strongest</strong> man in the world.</p>
<br>
	<p>If the adjective has two syllables but ends with the letter <strong>y</strong>, we have to change the <strong>y</strong> into an <strong>i</strong> before adding the ending <strong>est</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>My sister is the <strong>funniest</strong> person in the room.</p>
	<p>My room is the <strong>dirtiest</strong> in the house.</p>
<br>
	<p>If the adjective has two or more syllables, the adjective stays the same, but we have to add the word <strong>most</strong> before the adjective.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>My shirt was the <strong>most expensive</strong> shirt I have ever bought.</p>
	<p>New York is the <strong>most dangerous</strong> city on earth.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>When we use the superlative, we always have to use the article <strong>the</strong> before the superlative form.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>This picture is <strong>the</strong> cheapest in this exhibition.</p>
	<p>Mary is <strong>the</strong> most careful person.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Irregular Adjectives</h2></p>
	<p>Just like in German, there are some irregular adjectives. Here are some of the most common examples:</p>
	<p>Good, better, best</p>
	<p>Bad, worse, worst</p>
	<p>Far, further, furthest</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Adjectives ending in -ed or -ing:</h2></p>
	<p>Some adjectives can have two endings. For example <strong>boring</strong> and <strong>bored</strong>. But when do we use which one?</p>
<br>
	<p>Adjectives ending in <strong>-ing</strong> describe a situation, a person or a thing.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>This is so exciting.</p>
	<p>My brother is really annoying.</p>
	<p>This film is boring.</p>
<br>
	<p>Adjectives ending in <strong>-ed</strong> describe how people feel.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>The students are bored.</p>
	<p>John is very excited.</p>
