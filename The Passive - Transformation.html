	<p><h1>The Passive - Transformation</h1></p>
	<p>In English, we have the active and the passive voice. We can turn an active sentence into a passive one, and the other way around. On this page, you will learn how to do this.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Step-by-Step Transformation</h2></p>
	<p>Here you will find a step-by-step description of how to transform an active sentence into a passive one.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Step 1:</h2></p>
	<p>In order to transform an active sentence into a passive one, we need to identify the subject, verb and object of the sentence. Here is an example:</p>
	<p>My father makes a cake.</p>
	<p><strong>My father</strong> is the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>makes</strong> is the verb.</p>
	<p><strong>a cake</strong> is the object.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Step 2:</h2></p>
	<p>The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence.</p>
	<p>That means, that <strong>A cake</strong> is now at the beginning of the sentence.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Step 3:</h2></p>
	<p>Next, we have to identify the tense of the verb in the active sentence.</p>
	<p><strong>makes</strong> is in the Present Simple, so we also need the Present Simple in the passive sentence.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Step 4:</h2></p>
	<p>Now we transform the verb into the passive. Remember, that we need the verb "be" and the past participle to make the passive. The verb "be" adopts the tense (Present Simple).</p>
	<p>Passive verb form in the Present Simple: <strong>is made</strong></p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Step 5:</h2></p>
	<p>The last step is to add the subject of the active sentence.</p>
	<p>Here, it is very important that we us the preposition <strong>by</strong> before the word.</p>
	<p>Example: by my father.</p>
<br>
	<p>If we put everything together, we get the following passive sentence:</p>
	<p><strong>A cake is made by my father</strong>.</p>
<br>
