	<p><h1>Punctuation - Commas</h1></p>

	<p><h2>Commas in lists</h2></p>
	<p>We use commas to separate a list of similar words or phrases:</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>It is important to write in clear, simple, accurate words.</p>
	<p>They were more friendly, more talkative, more open than last time we met them.</p>
<br>
	<p>We do not normally use a comma before <strong>and</strong> at the end of a list of single words:</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>They travelled through Switzerland, Germany and Denmark.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Commas used for pauses</h2></p>
	<p>We use commas to separate words or phrases that mark where the voice would pause slightly:</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I can’t tell you now. However, all will be revealed tomorrow at midday.</p>
	<p>We had, in fact, lost all of our money.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Commas to seperate clauses</h2></p>
	<p>When main clauses are separated by <strong>and, or, but,</strong> we don’t normally use a comma if the clauses have the same subject. However, we sometimes use commas if the clauses have different subjects:</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>It was an expensive hotel in the centre of Stockholm, but we decided it was worth the money.</p>
<br>
	<p>When a subordinate clause comes before the main clause, we commonly use a comma to separate the clauses:</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>If you get lost in the city centre, please don’t hesitate to text us or phone us.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Commas and relative clauses</h2></p>
	<p>We use commas to mark non-defining clauses. Such clauses normally add extra, non-essential information about the noun or noun phrase:</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>The ambulance, which arrived after just five minutes, took three people to the hospital immediately.</p>
	<p>Hong Kong, where the first meeting was held, is a very different city now.</p>
<br>
<br>
	<p><h2>Quick Check</h2></p>
	<p>Choose the sentences with the correct punctuation:</p>

<br>
<br>
<input type="submit" name="Antworten prüfen" value="Antworten prüfen" onclick="result()" lang="de">

<script type="text/javascript" lang="de">
	var score=0;
	function result() {
	if (document.getElementById('correct1').checked)
	{
	score++;
	}
	if (document.getElementById('correct2').checked)
	{
	score++;
	}
	if (document.getElementById('correct3').checked)
	{
	score++;
	}
	alert("Richtige Antworten:"+score);
