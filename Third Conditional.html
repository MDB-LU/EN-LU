	<p><h1>Third Conditional</h1></p>
	<p>You already know that there are four types of conditional sentences. This one is called the <strong>Third Conditional</strong>.</p>
	<p>As every conditional sentence, this one also consists of two parts: The conditional clause and the main clause.</p>
<br>
	<p>We can make a third conditional sentence with the past perfect after in the conditional clause and the words <strong>would have and the past participle</strong> in the main clause.</p>
	<p><strong>If + past perfect / would + have + past participle</strong></p>
	<p>The third conditional talks about the past. It is used to describe a situation that did not happen, and to imagine the result of this situation.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>If she had studied, she would have passed the exam.</p>
	<p>I wouldn't have felt sick if I hadn't eaten so much.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Quick Check</h2></p>
	<p>Select the correct second conditional sentence:</p>
<br>
	<p>1.</p>
	<input type="radio" name="Q1" lang="de">He would have became a teacher, if he had gone to university.
	<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="correct1" lang="de">He would have become a teacher if he had gone to university.

	<p>2.</p>
