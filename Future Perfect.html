	<p><h1>Future Perfect</h1></p>
	<p>We use the <strong>Future Perfect</strong> when we look back to the past from a point in the future.</p>
	<p>To make the future perfect, we have to use the word <strong>will</strong>, the auxiliary verb <strong>have</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Next August, I will have worked ten years for this company.</p>
	<p>I will have finished the essay by next Monday.</p>
	<p>They will have stayed in Italy for three months tomorrow.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentence in the future perfect, we have to add the word <strong>not</strong> after <strong>will</strong> and before <strong>have</strong>.</p>
	<p>We can also use the abbreviation <strong>won't</strong> which stands for <strong>will not</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>They will not have finished their project by Friday.</p>
	<p>He won't have eaten breakfast before nine.</p>
	<p>We will not go on holiday before the end of the year.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Questions</h2></p>
	<p>We can also make questions in the future perfect. We just have to put <strong>will</strong> before the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Will you have eaten lunch already when we arrive?</p> 
	<p>Will they have changed their outfit before the break?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2><p>
	<p>The future perfect is only for actions that will be complete before a point in the future.</p>
	<p>The action you’re talking about must have a deadline. This deadline can be very specific (eight o’clock) or it can be vague (next week), it just has to be some time in the future.</p>
<br>
<br>
