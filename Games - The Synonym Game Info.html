	<p><h1>The Synonym Game</h1></p>
	<p>On this page, you can play a game which is all about <strong>Synonyms</strong></p>
	<p>This game is all about the different words that can have the same meaning.</p>
<br>
	<p>As soon as you click on the link below, a timer will start. There are <strong>three minutes</strong> on the clock.</p>
	<p>At the top of the page, you always have the same question: <strong>What is the synonym of ...?</strong></p>
	<p>Every question is about a different word. You always have four options. Navigate the page with <strong>arrow up and arrow down</strong> and choose the correct answer by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
	<p>The options will be read to you in English. After each option, you hear the word "Schalter". This stands for <span lang="de"><strong>Schalter</strong></span>.
	<p>You will find out if your answer was wrong or right and then the next question appears. To save time, I suggest pressing <strong>Control + Home</strong> to go to the beginning of the page, so you can hear the sentence.</p>
	<p>You will be informed once the time is up. After that, you can see how many questions you answered correctly.</p>
