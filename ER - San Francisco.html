	<p><h1>San Francisco</h1></p>
	<p>Below you will find some of San Francisco's most famous attractions:</p>
	
	<p><h2>Golden Gate Bridge</h2></p>
	<p>Once called the bridge that couldn't be built, today the Golden Gate Bridge is one the seven wonders of the modern world. This magnificent bridge, perhaps San Francisco's most famous landmark, opened in 1937 after a four-year struggle against relentless winds, fog, rocks, and treacherous tides. Spanning 1.7 miles from San Francisco to the Marin Headlands, the bridge’s sidewalks are open during the day to pedestrians, including wheelchair users and bicyclists</p>

	<p><h2>Alcatraz</h2></p>
	<p>Alcatraz was the site of the first lighthouse in the Western United States, but became a federal penitentiary from 1934 to 1963, housing famous convicts such as Al Capone and George "Machine Gun" Kelly. Now, this once infamous prison island is part of the Bay Area’s 80,000-acre Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Located one-and-a-half miles from Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz is one of the city's most popular attractions. A visit to the island includes a tour of the cell house where visitors can see where the prisoners lived.</p>

	<p><h2>Lombard Street</h2></p>
	<p>Often called the “crookedest” street in the world, this scenic road on Russian Hill features tight turns, fragrant gardens, and immaculate homes. Take a spectacular photo at the bottom of Lombard Street looking up or enjoy the breathtaking view from the top looking out onto the San Francisco Bay, the Bay Bridge and Coit Tower.</p>

	<p><h2>City Hall</h2></p>
	<p>Described as the "People's Palace," San Francisco's City Hall is a great historical stop near Civic Center and Hayes Valley. Built in 1915 and designed in the Beaux-Arts style, San Francisco's City Hall is an architectural wonder. With its beautiful grand staircase, interior dome, and light courts, City Hall is the perfect place to take a relaxing tour and an excellent backdrop for your special dinner or celebration.</p>

	<p><h2>Golden Gate Park</h2></p>
	<p>More than 24 million visitors put Golden Gate Park on their San Francisco bucket list. The park is home to some of San Francisco's most-visited attractions, including the Japanese Tea Garden, the San Francisco Botanical Garden, the de Young Museum, and the California Academy of Sciences. With miles of hidden pathways, green lawns, bridle paths, lakes, and 7,000 plant species right in the heart of San Francisco, Golden Gate Park is the third most-visited city park in the United States. Get around the park by foot, bikeOpens in new window, or take a guided Segway tour.</p>

	<p><h2>The Ferry Building</h2></p>
	<p>The San Francisco Ferry Building, an iconic landmark of the city, holds a rich history and is a must-visit attraction. With stunning bay views, the ferry building is still a starting point for exploring waterfront attractions.</p>
	<p>Initially built in 1898, it was the central transportation hub for ferries crossing the San Francisco Bay. Today, the beautifully restored building also houses a marketplace filled with artisanal food stalls, restaurants, and other shops.</p>
	<p>The food scene here is renowned, offering visitors critically acclaimed restaurants like the A16 and Hog Island Oyster Company. Its weekly farmers markets, where some of San Francisco's best chefs do their own shopping, are also a feast for the senses.</p>
