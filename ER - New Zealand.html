From the rolling green hills and serene beaches to the lush rainforests and dramatic fjords, New Zealand's natural beauty is unparalleled. The North Island features geothermal wonders like geysers and hot springs, while the South Island is home to the magnificent Southern Alps and the picturesque fjords of Fiordland National Park.</p>

	<p><h2>Rugby</h2></p>
	<p>One of the country's most significant cultural contributions is its excellence in rugby. The New Zealand All Blacks, the national rugby team, are famous worldwide for their dominance in the sport and their iconic pre-match haka, a traditional Maori war dance. Rugby is more than just a sport in New Zealand; it's a vital part of the national identity and a source of immense pride.</p>

	<p><h2>Film Industry</h2></p>
	<p>In addition to sports, New Zealand has made a notable mark on the film industry. The country's spectacular landscapes served as the primary filming location for Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies. These films brought the fantasy world of Middle-earth to life, showcasing the stunning scenery of places like Matamata , the volcanic terrain of Tongariro National Park, and the pristine Fiordland. The success of these films has attracted tourists from around the globe, eager to experience the magical landscapes firsthand.</p>

Whānau (family) and iwi (tribes) are central to Maori society, emphasizing community and connection to the land (whenua).
