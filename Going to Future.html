	<p><h1>Going to Future</h1></p>
	<p>We use the <strong>going to future</strong> to refer to various events that happen in the future.</p>
	<p>To make the <strong>going to future</strong>, we have to use the auxiliary verb <strong>be</strong>, the form <strong>going to</strong> and the <strong>base form (infinitive)</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I am going to take a few exams at the end of the year.</p>
	<p>She is going to start a new job in July.</p>
	<p>We're going to save money for a vacation.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentence in the going to future, we have to add the word <strong>not</strong> after the auxiliary verb <strong>be</strong> and before <strong>going to</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I am not going to fly ever again!</p>
	<p>She is not going to miss the bus again.</p>
	<p>My children aren't going to eat junk food anymore.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Questions</h2></p>
	<p>We can also make questions in the going to future. We just have to put the auxiliary verb <strong>be</strong> before the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Are you going to attend the meeting tomorrow?</p>
	<p>Is she going to travel abroad this summer?</p>
	<p>Are they going to invite us to their wedding?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2><p>
	<p>We use the <strong>going to future</strong> to talk about future plans. Usually, these plans are quite definitive. There is a big chance that this will happen.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>I am going to Basel tomorrow.</p>
	<p>We're going to eat in my favourite restaurant tonight.</p>
	<p>They're going to see a play next month.</p>
