	<p><h1>Present Simple</span></h1></p>
	<p>We use the Present Simple to describe habits, unchanging situations, general truths, and fixed arrangements.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Simple - Positive</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a positive sentence in the Present Simple, we can use the <strong>base form (infinitive)</strong> of the verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I work in a bank.</p>
	<p>They play football in a club.</p>
	<p>We celebrate Christmas every year.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Simple - Negative</h2></p>
	<p>We can also make negative sentences in the Present Simple. For this, we have to use an auxiliary verb. Most of the time, this auxiliary verb is <strong>don't</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Don't</strong> stands for <strong>do not</strong>.
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I don't work in a bank.</p>
	<p>They don't play football.</p>
	<p>We don't celebrate Christmas.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Simple - Questions</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to ask a question in the Present Simple, we have to use an auxiliary verb. Most of the time, this auxiliary verb is <strong>do</strong>.
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Do you work in a bank?</p>
	<p>Do they play football?</p>
	<p>Do I look good?</p>

	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>We can use the <strong>base form (infinitive)</strong> of the verb in positive sentences, the auxiliary verb <strong>don't</strong> in negative sentences, and the auxiliary verb <strong>do</strong> in every person except for the third person singular.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>First person singular: I work in a bank. I don't work in a bank. Do I work in a bank?</p>
	<p>Second person singular: You work in a bank. You don't work in a bank. Do you work in a bank?</p>
	<p>First person plural: We work in a bank. We don't work in a bank. Do we work in a bank?.</p>
	<p>Second person plural: You work in a bank. You don't work in a bank. Do you work in a bank?</p>
	<p>Third person plural: work in a bank. They don't work in a bank. Do they work in a bank?.</p>
