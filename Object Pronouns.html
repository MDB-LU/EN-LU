	<p><h1>Object Pronouns</h1></p>
	<p>We use object pronouns when we want to substitute a noun that has the role of the object in a sentence. The object in a sentence is the receiver of the action.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Do you know Anna? Yes, I saw <strong>her</strong> today.</p>
	<p>He didn't like his watch, so he gave <strong>it</strong> to his brother.</p>
<br>
	<p>Every person has its own object pronoun:</p>
	<p>I = me</p>
	<p>You = you</p>
	<p>He = him</p>
	<p>She = her</p>
	<p>It = it</p>
	<p>We = us</p>
	<p>You = you</p>
	<p>They = Them</p>
<br>
	<p>Object pronouns are used instead of nouns, usually because we already know what the object is. It makes the sentence easier to read and avoids repetition.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>He gave his watch away because he didn't like it. <strong>NOT:</strong> He gave his watch away because he didn't like his watch.</p>

	<div id="1_solution" style="display: none;">her</div></p>

	<p>This is a nice car, but I don't really want to buy <input type="text" id="2">

        <button onclick="toggleSolution('3')" lang="de">Lösung anzeigen</button>
	<div id="3_solution" style="display: none;">them</div></p>
<br>
    <script>
        function toggleSolution(id) {
            var solution = document.getElementById(id + "_solution");
            if (solution.style.display === "none") {
                solution.style.display = "inline";
            } else {
                solution.style.display = "none";
