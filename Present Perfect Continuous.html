	<p><h1>Present Perfect Continuous</h1></p>
	<p>We use the present perfect continuous to talk about a finished activity in the recent past. Using the present perfect continuous focuses on the activity.</p>
	<p>Even though the activity is finished, we can see the result in the present.</p>
	<p>We make the Present Perfect Continuous with <strong>have been</strong> and the <strong>ing form</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I have been cleaning the car. (Present Result: The car is now wet and clean.)</p>
	<p>It has been snowing. (Present Result: The ground is now covered in snow.)</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentences in the Present Perfect Continuous, we need to add the word <strong>not</strong>. This word comes between <strong>have</strong> and <strong>been</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I have not been feeling well.</p>
	<p>He has not been paying attention.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Questions</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to ask a question in the Present Perfect Continuous, we have to put the auxiliary verb <strong>have</strong> in front of the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Have you been working a lot lately?</p>
	<p>What have you been thinking about?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>We can use the Present Perfect Continuous for one continuing event that began in the past and is still going on.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>He has been living in London since 1995. (He is still living in London).</p>
<br>
	<p>We can also use the Present Perfect Continuous to talk about repeated activities which started in the past and are still going on.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>They have been going to Spain on holiday every year since 1987.</p>
