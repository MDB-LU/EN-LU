	<p><h3>2. Step</h3></p>
	<p>The second step of this task is to download the Worksheet. Click the following link to download it. Complete all the exercises on the worksheet before you come back to the <span lang="de">Lernumgebung</span>.</p>
	<p><a href="SH - Worksheet.docx" target="_blank">Worksheet</a></p>
<br>
	<p><h3>3. Step</h3></p>
	<p>Great! You have completed the worksheet and maybe you have learnt a bit more about some superheroes. You need this knowledge because in this part of the course, you will create your own superhero. And because a Hero always needs someone who causes trouble, you also have to create a supervillain.</p>
	<p>Download the following worksheet and follow the instructions on there.</p>
	<p><a href="SH - Worksheet 2.html" target="_blank">Worksheet 2</a></p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Final Check</h3></p>
	<p>Make sure you have sent both worksheets to Mr Du Buisson (marc.dubuisson@sibu.ch). If you have done so, you have finished the course and you will soon get feedback on your superheroes and your superhero story.</p>
