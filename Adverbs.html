	<p><h1>Adverbs</h1></p>
	<p>An adverb is a word that describes a verb, an adjective, another adverb or even a whole clause.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He sings <strong>loudly</strong>. (The adverb <strong>loudly</strong> describes the verb <strong>sings</strong>.)</p>
	<p>She is <strong>very</strong> tall. (The adverb <strong>very</strong> describes the adjective <strong>tall</strong>.)</p>
	<p>The presentation ended <strong>too</strong> quickly. (The adverb <strong>too</strong> describes another adverb: <strong>quickly</strong>.)</p>
	<p><strong>Fortunately</strong>, I had brought an umbrella. (The adverb <strong>fortunately</strong> describes the whole clause.)</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Adverbs - Endings</h2></p>
	<p>Adverbs often end in <strong>-ly</strong>:</p>
	<p><strong>loudly, slowly, happily, quickly, badly, really</strong></p>
<br>
	<p>But there are also adverbs, that look the same as the adjective:</p>
	<p><strong>fast, far, long, early</strong></p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Adverbs - Placement</h2><p>
	<p>In general, adverbs should be placed as close as possible to the words they describe. Placing the adverb in the wrong spot could completely change the meaning of the sentence. Consider the difference in meaning between the following two sentences:</p>
	<p>1. I almost dropped all the plates I was holding.</p>
	<p>2. I dropped almost all the plates I was holding.</p>
	<p>In the first sentence, the person did not drop the plates. Nothing fell to the ground. In the second sentence, the person did drop the plates, but not all of them. This shows you that it is really important where you place the adjective.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Adverbs - Types</h2></p>
	<p>Adverbs have different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time, manner, place, degree and frequency of something.</p>
	<p><strong>Example for time:</strong> I never get up <strong>early</strong> at the weekends.</p>
	<p><strong>Example for manner:</strong> Walk across the road <strong>carefully</strong>!</p>
	<p><strong>Example for place:</strong> When we got <strong>there</strong>, they had already left.</p>
	<p><strong>Example for degree:</strong> It is <strong>rather</strong> cold, isn't it?</p>
	<p><strong>Example for frequency:</strong> I'm <strong>always</strong> late for work.</p>
