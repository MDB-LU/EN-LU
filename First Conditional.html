	<p><h1>First Conditional</h1></p>
	<p>You already know that there are four types of conditional sentences. This one is called the <strong>First Conditional</strong>.</p>
	<p>As every conditional sentence, this one also consists of two parts: The conditional clause and the main clause.</p>
<br>
	<p>We can make a first conditional sentence with the present simple in the conditional clause and the will future in the main clause:</p>
	<p><strong>If + present simple / will + infinitive</strong></p>
	<p>The first conditional is used to talk about things which might happen in the future. Of course, we can't know what will happen in the future, but this describes possible things, which could easily come true.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>If it rains, I won't go to the park.</p>
	<p>She will be late if the train is delayed.</p>
	<p>If I see her, I will tell her.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Quick Check</h2></p>
