	<p><h1>Past Perfect Continuous</h1></p>
	<p>We use the Past Perfect Continuous to talk about actions or events which started before a particular time in the past and were still in progress up to that time in the past.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>It was so difficult to get up last Monday for school. I <strong>had been working</strong> on my essays the night before. (The past perfect continuous focuses on the activity of working on the essays up to a particular time in the past.)</p>
<br>
	<p>We make the Past Perfect Continuous with <strong>had been</strong> and the <strong>ing form</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Her friends <strong>had been</strong> thinking of calling the police when she walked in.</p>
	<p>It <strong>had been raining</strong> hard for several hours when I got the call.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past Perfect Continuous - Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentences in the Past Perfect Continuous, we need to add the word <strong>not</strong>. This word comes between <strong>had</strong> and <strong>been</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He had not been waiting for the bus for that long before it arrived.</p>
	<p>We had not been planning the trip for a long time before we actually booked the tickets.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past Perfect Continuous - Questions</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to ask a question in the Past Perfect Continuous, we have to put the auxiliary verb <strong>had</strong> in front of the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Had she been studying for a long time before she took a break?</p>
	<p>How long had they been living in that house for before they decided to move?</p>
<br>


	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>We can also use the Past Perfect Continuous to talk about events which started before a time in the past and which finished, but where the effects or results were still important at a point in the past.</p>
	<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
	<p>It had been raining and the ground was still wet. (The action of raining is already finished, but the result of the wet ground is still important.</p>
