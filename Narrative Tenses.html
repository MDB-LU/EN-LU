	<p><h1>Narrative Tenses</h1></p>
	<p>We use narrative tenses to talk about the past. We can use them to tell a story or to describe past events, including personal anecdotes.</p>
	<p>The four narrative tenses are the <strong>past simple, past continuous, past perfect and past perfect continuous</strong>. If you would like to repeat one of these tenses, make sure to click the respective link below:</p>

<br>
	<p><h2>Past Simple</h2></p>
	<p>We can use the <strong>past simple</strong> for actions that started and finished in the past, for example a series of events in someone’s life.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>Nelson Mandela <strong>was</strong> born in 1918. He <strong>became</strong> the first black President of South Africa. He <strong>spent</strong> 27 years in prison in his battle against the system of apartheid.</p>
<br>
	<p>The past simple is often used in stories and dialogue.</p>
	<p>When Bobby went down for breakfast, Matt looked up.</p>
	<p>"Did you hear the storm last night?"</p>
	<p>Bobby didn’t answer.</p>
	<p>"Your brother went out last night. He didn’t come back. Do you know where he went?"</p>
	<p>Bobby’s heart sank. He knew exactly where Dan had gone.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past continuous</h2></p>
	<p>We use the <strong>past continuous</strong> for background information and to describe a scene or situation that continued for some time.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>	
	<p>At 6 o’clock that evening Dan <strong>was still missing</strong>. Bobby <strong>was feeling</strong> worried.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past simple and past continuous</h2></p>
	<p>We often use the <strong>past simple</strong> and <strong>past continuous</strong> together when one action interrupts another.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I <strong>was strolling</strong> along the beach one day when suddenly, my dog <strong>ran</strong> away.</p>
	<p>It <strong>was still raining</strong> when Bobby <strong>woke up</strong> the next morning.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past simple and past perfect</h2></p>
	<p>We can use the <strong>past perfect</strong> with the past simple together in a sentence to describe an action that happened before another past action.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>	
	<p>I quickly <strong>realised</strong> that the storm the previous night <strong>had washed up</strong> the body.</p>
	<p>James <strong>knew</strong> that Maria <strong>hadn’t wanted</strong> to come home.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Past perfect continuous</h2></p>
	<p>We use the <strong>past perfect continuous</strong> to describe something that has been happening over a long period of time.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>	
	<p>I could tell that the body <strong>had been lying</strong> on the beach for several hours because the man’s clothes were dry.</p>
