	<p><h1>Parts of Speech</h1></p>
	<p>Every word in English can be classified as a part of speech (<span lang="de">Wortart</span>). On this page, we will focus on seven parts of speech.</p>

	<p><h2>1. Nouns</h2></p>
	<p>A noun is a word for a person, place, thing, or idea. Nouns are often used with an article, but not always.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I live in a <strong>house</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Life</strong> is unfair.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>2. Pronouns</h2></p>
	<p>A pronoun is a word used in place of a noun. There are several types of pronouns:</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Personal Pronouns</h3></p>
	<p>Personal pronouns refer to specific persons or things.</p>
	<p>Personal pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they; me, him, her, us, them</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>I</strong> like <strong>her</strong> very much.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Possessive Pronouns</h3></p>
	<p>Possessive pronouns indicate ownership.</p>
	<p>Possessive pronouns: mine, yours, his, hers.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Do you see this car? That's <strong>mine</strong>.</p>
	<p>whose hat is that? It's <strong>hers</strong>.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>BE CAREFUL</h3></p>
	<p>The words <strong>my, your, his, her, our, their</strong> are not pronouns but adjectives. Click the following link to learn more about them:</p>

<br>
	<p><h3>Relative Pronouns</h3></p>
	<p>Relative pronouns introduce a subordinate clause (<span lang="de">Nebensatz</span>).</p>
	<p>Relative pronouns: that, which, who, whom, whose, what.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>The teacher <strong>who</strong> helped me the most was Mr Kent.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Demonstrative Pronouns</h3></p>
	<p>Demonstrative pronouns identify, point to, or refer to nouns.</p>
	<p>Demonstrative pronouns: this, that, these, those.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Those</strong> flowers are beautiful.</p>
	<p><strong>This</strong> building is very old.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>3. Verbs</h2></p>
	<p>The verb in a sentence expresses action or being. A verb can also take different forms to express when something happens.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He <strong>plays</strong> the piano.</p>
	<p>They <strong>played</strong> the guitar.</p>
	<p>I <strong>will play</strong> the cello tomorrow.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>4. Adjectives</h2></p>
	<p>An adjective is a word used to modify or describe a noun or a pronoun.
We can change adjectives by making them stronger with the comparative and the superlative.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>The tree is <strong>big</strong>.</p>
	<p>She is <strong>smaller</strong> than her sister.</p>
	<p>New York is <strong>more dangerous</strong> than London.</p>
	<p>This drink is <strong>the cheapest</strong>.</p>
	<p>My car is <strong>the most expensive</strong> car ever.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>5. Adverbs</h2></p>
	<p>An An adverb describes or modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb, but never a noun. Adverbs usually answer the questions of when, where, how, why, under what conditions, or to what degree. They often end with <strong>-ly</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>He sings <strong>badly</strong>.</p>
	<p>Beth is <strong>incredibly</strong> proud.</p>
	<p>She <strong>usually</strong> goes to church on Saturday.</p>
	<p>I'm still waiting <strong>outside</strong>.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>6. Prepositions</h2></p>
	<p>Prepositions link a word to another part of the sentence and tell us what the relationship is, for example in space or time.</p>
	<p>Prepositions: in, at, on, since, for, until, by, between, of, with, from.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>We went <strong>to</strong> school <strong>on</strong> Monday.</p>
	<p>I saw him <strong>at</strong> the weekend <strong>after</strong> the game.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>7. Conjunction</h2></p>
	<p>A conjunction joins words, phrases, or clauses, and indicates the relationship between the elements joined.</p>
	<p>Conjunctions: and, but, or, while, because, when, if.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>I like cats <strong>and</strong> dogs, <strong>but</strong> I don't like horses.</p>
