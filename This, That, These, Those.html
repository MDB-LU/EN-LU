	<p><h1>This, That, These, Those</h1></p>
	<p>The four words are used a lot in English. On this page, you will learn when to use which one.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>This and That</h2></p>
	<p>We use <strong>this and that</strong> if we want to point out <strong>one thing (singular)</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>This is a book.</p>
	<p>Do you see that house over there?</p>
<br>
	<p><strong>This</strong> is used for pointing to a thing or a person which is close to the speaker.</p>
	<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> I need this bottle. (The bottle is very close to the speaker)</p>
	<p><strong>That</strong> is used for pointing to a thing or a person which is further away from the speaker.</p>
	<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> I need that bottle. (The bottle is further away from the speaker than in the first example)</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>These and Those</h2></p>
	<p>We use <strong>these and those</strong> if we want to point out <strong>multiple things (plural)</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>These flowers are lovely.</p>
	<p>I don't like those buildings.</p>
<br>		
	<p><strong>This</strong> is used for pointing to things or people which are close to the speaker.</p>
	<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> These houses are very modern. (The speaker is standing right in front of these houses)</p>
	<p><strong>That</strong> is used for pointing to things or people which are further away from the speaker.</p>
	<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Those houses are very modern. (The speaker is further away from the houses than in the first example)</p>
