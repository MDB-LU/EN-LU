	<p><h1>Second Conditional</h1></p>
	<p>You already know that there are four types of conditional sentences. This one is called the <strong>Second Conditional</strong>.</p>
	<p>As every conditional sentence, this one also consists of two parts: The conditional clause and the main clause.</p>
<br>
	<p>We can make a second conditional sentence with the past simple in the conditional clause and would + infinitive in the main clause:</p>
	<p><strong>If + past simple / would + infinitive</strong></p>
	<p>We can use <strong>were</strong> instead of <strong>was</strong> with <strong>I</strong> and <strong>he, she, it</strong>.
<br>
	<p>The second conditional has two uses:</p>
	<p>First, we can use it to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.</p>
<br>
	<p>Second, we can use it to talk about something in the present which is impossible, because it's not true.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>If I had his number, I would call him.
<br>
	<p><h2>Quick Check</h2></p>
