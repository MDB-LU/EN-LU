	<p><h1>The Passive</h1></p>
	<p>In English, we have the active and the passive voice. On this page, we will focus on the passive.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>The Passive - Uses</h2></p>
	<p>We use the passive for multiple reasons:</p>
	<p>1: We want to focus on the person or the thing affected by the action.</p>
	<p><strong>Example</strong>: Jurassic Park was directed by Steven Spielberg. (The focus of this sentence is on the film Jurassic Park)</p>
	<p>2: We don't know who or what did an action.</p>
	<p><strong>Example</strong>: My car has been stolen. (I don't know who did it)</p>
	<p>3: When it is not important or obvious who did an acion.</p>
	<p><strong>Example</strong>: The criminal is being arrested. (Here, we know that the police has arrested the criminal)</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>The Passive - Form</h2></p>
	<p>We make the passive form with <strong>the verb "be"</strong> and the <strong>past participle</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>This product <strong>is produced</strong> in China.</p>
	<p>The story <strong>was reported</strong> in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
	<p>A discovery <strong>has been made</strong>.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>The Passive in different tenses</h2></p>
	<p>We can use the passive in different tenses. The past participle always stays the same, no matter what the tense we are in. The <strong>verb "be"</strong> always adopts the tense.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p><strong>Present Simple</strong>: A cake <strong>is</strong> made by my father.</p>
	<p><strong>Past Simple</strong>: E.T. <strong>was</strong> directed by Steven Spielberg.</p>
	<p><strong>Present Perfect</strong>: My car <strong>has been</strong> stolen.</p>
	<p><strong>Present Continuous</strong>: The criminal <strong>is being</strong> arrested by the police.</p>
