	<p><h1>Reported Speech</h1></p>
	<p>Reported speech is how we represent the speech of other people or ourselves.</p>
	<p>There are two main types of reported speech: direct speech and indirect speech.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Direct Speech</h2></p>
	<p>Direct speech repeats the same words the person used:</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Kimberly said, “I realise it was a mistake.”
	<p>"I'm hungry", said James.</p>
	<p>"She doesn't like you", said John.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Indirect Speech</h2></p>
	<p>In indirect speech, the original speaker’s words are changed.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Kimberly said that she realised it was a mistake.</p>
	<p>James said that he was hungry.</p>
	<p>John told me that she didn't like me.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Backshift</h3></p>
	<p>When we change a sentence from direct speech to indirect speech, we often use a tense which is "further back" in the past. This is called a <strong>backshift</strong>.</p>
	<p>Here is an examples:</p>
	<p><strong>Direct Speech:</strong> "I travel a lot", said Harry.</p>
	<p><strong>Indirect Speech:</strong> Harry said that he travelled a lot.</p>
	<p>In the direct speech, we have the <strong>Present Simple (travel)</strong>. In the indirect speech, this changes to the </strong>Past Simple (travelled)</strong>.</p>
<br>
	<p>Here's how the different tenses change in reported speech:</p>
	<p><strong>Present Simple:</strong></p>
	<p>The present simple changes to the past simple.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I travel a lot", said Harry. = Harry said that he travelled a lot.</p>
	<p><strong>Present Continuous:</strong></p>
	<p>The present continuous changes to the past continuous.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I'm travelling a lot", said Harry. = Harry said that he was travelling a lot.</p>
	<p><strong>Present Perfect:</strong></p>
	<p>The present perfect changes to the past perfect.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I have travelled a lot", said Harry. = Harry said that he had travelled a lot.</p>
	<p><strong>Past Simple:</strong></p>
	<p>The past simple changes to the past perfect.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I travelled a lot", said Harry. = Harry said that he had travelled a lot.</p>
	<p><strong>Past Continuous:</strong></p>
	<p>The past continuous changes to the past perfect continuous.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong> "I was travelling a lot", said Harry. = Harry said that he had been travelling a lot.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Pronouns, demonstratives and adverbs</h3></p>
	<p>Pronouns usually change in indirect speech.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>Direct Speech: "I enjoy working in <strong>my</strong> garden," said Bob.</p>
	<p>Indirect Speech: Bob said that he enjoyed working in <strong>his</strong> garden.</p>
<br>
	<p>Demonstratives and adverbs of time and place change as well, especially when they are no longer accurate.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Direct Speech: "<strong>This</strong> is my car", he said.</p>
	<p>Indirect Speech: He told me <strong>that</strong> was his car.</p>
	<p>Direct Speech: "I like it <strong>here</strong>", she said.</p>
	<p>Indirect Speech: She said that she liked it <strong>there</strong>.</p>
	<p>Direct Speech: "I came home <strong>yesterday</strong>", I said.</p>
	<p>Indirect Speech: I said that I had come home <strong>the day before</strong>.</p>
