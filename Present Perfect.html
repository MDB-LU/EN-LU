	<p><h1>Present Perfect</h1></p>
	<p>We use the Present Perfect to refer to events in the past which connect to the present. In order to form the Present Perfect, we need the auxiliary verb <strong>have</strong> and the <strong>Past Participle</strong> of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>You have lived in Liverpool for most of your life.</p>
	<p>I have eaten too much.</p>
	<p>He has watched a lot of movies lately.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Perfect - Negative</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to make a negative sentences in the Present Perfect, we need to add the word <strong>not</strong>. This word comes between the auxiliary verb and the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>I have not called home for a while.</p>
	<p>You haven't played a lot of games recently.</p>
	<p>He hasn't gone on holiday with his family.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>Present Perfect - Questions</h2></p>
	<p>If we want to ask a question in the Present Perfect, we have to put the auxiliary verb <strong>have</strong> in front of the subject.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Have you seen Jenny?</p>
	<p>Have they stayed in a hotel?</p>
	<p>Has he been to the doctor's yet?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>We use the Present Perfect to talk about experiences up to now. The time of that experience is not important.</p>
	<p>Example: I have seen Barbie in cinemas. <strong>In this sentence, the main message is that I have seen the film. It doesn't matter when that was.</strong></p>
	<p>We can also use the Present Perfect to talk about things that are not finished yet.</p>
	<p>Example: I have visited my grandmother two times this year. <strong>The year is not yet finished, so I can still visit my grandmother more times.</strong></p>
<br>
