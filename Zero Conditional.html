	<p><h1>Zero Conditional</h1></p>
	<p>You already know that there are four types of conditional sentences. This one is called the <strong>Zero Conditional</strong>.</p>
	<p>As every conditional sentence, this one also consists of two parts: The conditional clause and the main clause.</p>
<br>
	<p>We can make a zero conditional sentence with two present simple verbs. One in the conditional clause and one in the main clause:</p>
	<p><strong>If + present simple / present simple</strong></p>
	<p>The zero conditional is used when the result will always happen. It's a fact. The result of the conditional clause is always the main clause.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>If water reaches 100 degrees, it always boils.</p>
	<p>You get burned if you touch fire.</p>
	<p>People die if they don't eat.</p>
<br>
