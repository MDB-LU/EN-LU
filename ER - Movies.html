	<p>New Zealand is widely regarded as one of the world's premier locations for screen production. The on- and off-screen talent, the production facilities, and the unique landscapes continue to make an important contribution to the sector and the wider New Zealand economy.</p>
	<p>The screen industry covers a wide range of businesses, including: production, post-production, digital and special effects, television broadcasting, film and video distribution, and film exhibition.</p>
