	<p><h1>Past Simple - Questions</h1></p>
	<p>If we want to make questions in the Past Simple, we have to use an auxiliary verb. Most of the time this auxiliary verb is <strong>did</strong>.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Did you sleep well?</p>
	<p>Did you go to school in England?</p>
	<p>Did you play football last weekend?</p>
<br>
	<p>We use the auxiliary verb <strong>did</strong> in every person.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Did I work yesterday?</p>
	<p>Did you work yesterday?</p>
	<p>Did he work yesterday? / Did she work yesterday? / Did it work yesterday?</p>
	<p>Did we work yesterday?</p>
	<p>Did you work yesterday?</p>
	<p>Did they work yesterday?</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>When we use the auxiliary verb <strong>did</strong>, we have to use the base form (infinitive) of the main verb.</p>
	<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
	<p>Did you play football last weekend? <strong>NOT:</strong> Did you played football last weekend?</p>
	<p>Did she catch the ball? <strong>NOT:</strong> Did she caught the ball?</p>
<br>
