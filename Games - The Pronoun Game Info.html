	<p><h1>The Pronoun Game</h1></p>
	<p>On this page, you can play a game called which is all about <strong>pronouns</strong></p>
	<p>If you want to look at the topic before playing the game, I suggest looking at the <strong>pronoun</strong> section on the following page:</p>
	<p><a href="Parts of Speech.html" target="_blank">Parts of Speech</a></p>
<br>
	<p>As soon as you click on the link below, a timer will start. There are <strong>three minutes</strong> on the clock.</p>
	<p>At the top of the page, you always have a sentence with one one gap. Below you will find four options. Every option is a pronoun and you have to choose the correct one.</p>
	<p>Navigate the page with <strong>arrow up and arrow down</strong> and choose the correct answer by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
	<p>The options will be read to you in English. After each option, you hear the word "Schalter". This stands for <span lang="de"><strong>Schalter</strong></span>.
	<p>You will find out if your answer was wrong or right and then the next sentence appears. To save time, I suggest pressing <strong>Control + Home</strong> to go to the beginning of the page, so you can hear the sentence.</p>
	<p>You will be informed once the time is up. After that, you can see how many questions you answered correctly.</p>
