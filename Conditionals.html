	<p><h1>Conditionals</h1></p>
	<p>Conditional sentences consider imagined or uncertain situations and the possible results of these situations. The most common types of conditional sentences involve the word <strong>if</strong>.</p>
	<p>A conditional sentence has two parts. The conditional clause and the main clause.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>If a lot of people come, we will have to get extra chairs.</p>
	<p>The conditional clause is: <strong>If a lot of people come</strong></p>
	<p>The main clause is: <strong>we will have to get extra chairs</strong></p>
<br>
	<p>The order of the two clauses does not matter. The conditional clause can come before or after the main clause.</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
	<p>Conditional clause first: If a lot of people come, we will have to get extra chairs.</p>	
	<p>Conditional clause second: We will have to get extra chairs if a lot of people come.</p>
<br>
	<p><h2>IMPORTANT</h2></p>
	<p>If the conditional clause comes first, we have to add a comma at the end of the clause.</p>
<br>
	<p><h3>Quick Check</h3></p>
	<p>Do this little quiz before you go deeper into the conditional sentences.</p>
<br>
	<p>1. How many parts does a conditional sentence have?</p>
	<input type="radio" name="Q1" lang="de">one
	<input type="radio" name="Q1" id="correct1" lang="de">two
	<input type="radio" name="Q1" lang="de">three

	<p>2. In which clause does the word <strong>if</strong> show up?</p>
